# QSO_S82_DRW_vs_DHO
This repository runs a CARMA  analysis of sdss STRIPE 82 Quasar lightcurves. The purpose is to compare Damped Random Walk (DRW) and Damped Harmonic Oscillator (DHO) stochastic modelling of Quasar survey data like SDSS. We also produce Green's Functions, Structure Functions and Power Spectra to estimate characteristic timescales and relate them to physical properties like wavelength, Luminosity, Black Hole Mass and Eddington Ratio
